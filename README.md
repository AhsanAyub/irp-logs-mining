## I/O Request Packet (IRP) Logs Driven Ransomware Detection Scheme

The project aims to extract pattern(s) of malicious processes (e.g., ransomware) from the IRP logs that were generated by running 272 ransomware samples on a Windows machine. Besides, there are labelled benign IRP logs that were recorded in different sessions of users' machine which did not have any malicious program installed.

All the ransomware samples were labelled and grouped with its families with the help of [AVClass](https://github.com/malicialab/avclass) - a malware labelling tool and [VirusTotal](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference) API engine. After the datasets are processed and labelled, we constructed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model in order to perform binary classification (detection of benign and malicious logs).

The research project has been published at the IEEE 21st International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science [(IEEE IRI 2020)](https://homepages.uc.edu/~niunn/IRI20/).
