# Data Mining of Malicious I/O Request Packet (IRP) Logs

This project aims to extract pattern(s) of malicious processes (e.g. ransomware) from the IRP logs that were generated by running 386 ransomware samples on a Windows machine. Besides, there are labelled benign IRP logs that were recorded in different sessions of a user's machine which did not have any malicious program installed.
